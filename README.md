# Android-Weather-App
Designed an Android App in Android studio. When user opens app, it prompts for accessing device’s location. This app requires two permissions – INTERNET &amp; GPS Access (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION). GPS is implemented by using LocationManager &amp; LocationListener. This App has 3 activities – main activity (for GPS &amp; output), ByCityName, ByZipCode. Unlike previous versions of android, the newer versions have feature of checking for permissions at run time. So, App prompts the user to grant permission at the time of launching the app but not at the time of installing.  If user accepts, then weather information - Temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius, wind speed, humidity, city name, weather condition and weather description. User also have option of fetching weather details based on city name &amp; zip code.
